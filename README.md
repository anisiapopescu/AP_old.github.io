I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam) and the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My reseach focusses on speech production and perception. I am interested in the organization and timing patters of speech gestures and the mental representation of these patterns. I am also interested speech development,  in particular how speech fluency is affected literacy acquisition in early childhood.
