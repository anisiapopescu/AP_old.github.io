I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam) and the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My reseach focusses on speech production and perception in a laboratory phonology approach and from a developmental perspective. My main interest has been the timing of gestural coordination patterns, acoustic-articulatory relations and the cognitive representation of
phonological and prosodic units. From a developmental perspective, I am interested in speech production in children, specifically how speech production interacts with segmental representation, through metalinguistic skills such as reading proficiency.
