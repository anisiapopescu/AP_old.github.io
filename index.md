I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam) and the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My reseach focusses on speech production and perception. I am interested in the organization and timing patters of speech gestures and the mental representation of these patterns. I am also interested speech development,  in particular how speech fluency is affected literacy acquisition in early childhood.

## Research projects

### A gestural account of sesquisyllables
  Sesquisyllables - words involving tense vowels or diphthongs followed by a liquid consonant (*feel, file, pier, pyre*) - receive variable syllable count judgments. This study proposes that syllable count judgments are related to subsegmental representations in the rime, and in particular to the gestural specification of coda liquids. (Popescu,  54th Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society CLS54, Popescu & Chitoran (in preparation))
  
### Coarticulation and Reading acquisition
  This study investigates the relationship between reading proficiency and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency, in beginning readers of German, a language which supports rather consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships. Results show that more proficient readers exhibit lower degrees of anticipatory coarticulation in CV sequences. ([Popescu & Noiray, LLD, 2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15475441.2021.1941032))

### Acoustic-Articulatory Relations
  The goal of this project is to study the link between speech acoustics and articulation in lateral consonants. ([Popescu, ASA & ASJ 2017](https://github.com/anisiapopescu/anisiapopescu.github.io/blob/main/images/ASA_F3_poster.pdf))
