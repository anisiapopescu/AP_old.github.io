I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam) and the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My reseach focusses on speech production and perception. I am interested in the organization and timing patters of speech gestures and the mental representation of these patterns. I am also interested speech development,  in particular how speech fluency is affected literacy acquisition in early childhood.

## Research projects

### A gestural account of sesquisyllables
  Sesquisyllables - words involving tense vowels or diphthongs followed by a liquid consonant (*feel, file, pier, pyre*) - receive variable syllable count judgments. This study proposes that syllable count judgments are related to subsegmental representations in the rime, and in particular to the gestural specification of coda liquids.

### Coarticulation and Reading acquisition
  This study investigates the relationship between reading proficiency and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency, in beginning readers of German, a language which supports rather consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships. Results show that more proficient readers exhibit lower degrees of anticipatory coarticulation in CV sequences.
